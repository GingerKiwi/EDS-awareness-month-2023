# EDS-awareness-month-2023

## Contest details and LinkedIn posts for 2023 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Awareness Month (May)

Contest for a Custom Knit Hat:

1) I've been knitting since I was six and design about half of the projects that I knit. Hats are one of my favourite knitting projects. The winner can choose a cabled and/or multi-colour hat. As knitting is binary it's easy to include a hidden short message in binary in the stitch or colour pattern.
2) Points will be awarded for interactions with 20 LinkedIn posts over the month of May 2023.
	1) 1 point for reacting to a post (eg like, love, ...)
	2) 2 points for commenting on a post
	3) 3 points for answering a quiz question in the comments 
	4) 4 points for reposting on LinkedIn or answering a quiz question where you have to Google the answer
	5) 5 points for reposting on LinkedIn as your own post with adding at least 50 words.
	6) 1000 points if you get me an interview for a frontend javascript dev job (only partly joking)
3) I'll tally the points awarded in a markdown file on a new GitHub repo at least every Sunday, and post updates on LinkedIn every Monday. Ideally I'll update the .md file daily or every other day, but life is busy and I've got so much going on.
4) The person with the most points by Friday, June 2nd will win the hat.
5) The winner will be posted on LinkedIn on Monday, June 5th, 2023.

### Example of Daily Points Awarded
Rubber Duck reacts to a post, then answers two quiz questions in the comments, and reposts the post without starting a new one.
duckPoints  = [1, 3, 3, 4]
sum of duckPoints = 8
